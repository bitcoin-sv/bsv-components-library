 * A simple in-Memory Publish/Subscribe EventBus Implementation:
 * You subscribe for an specific Event Type, providing a piece of Code (Consumer/Event Handler) that will be executed
 * (notified) whenever an Event of that type is published to the Bus.
 *
 * Yu can also specify if the Event Handler will be executed in the same Thread as the main App or in a multi-thread
 * environment. If you specify an ExecutorSerice in the constructor, that wil be used to submit task, otherwise they will
 * be run in the same Thread.
 *
 * The EventBus allows for 2-level priority Events, you can specfy what evetn are the ones with higer priority. In order
 * to enable this fetaure, you need to:
 * - Pass an additional executor (executorHighPriority) in the constructor. This will be used for the high-priority
 *   Events.
 * - Pass a Function in the constructor that will be used to decide the priority of each Event.
 *
