 * An EventStreamer offers a more conveniente way to subscribe to Events and provide a callback
 * that will be triggered when the Event occurs.
 * The EvenSttreamer can "stream" events by calling the calback function injected by the "forEach" method.
 * Some filters can also be specified in the constructor, so not all evetns are processed. The source of the
 * Events is the EventBus provided in the constructor. This class subscribe to the events triggered by that
 * event, and for each event trigger by the EventBus, a call to the callback function is made (so that event
 * is "streamed" to the client of this class).
 * In order to "disconnect" the source of the events (EventBus fed in the constructor) from the client of this
 * class, everytime an event is triggered by the source, that Event is NOT processed by our callback, instead it
 * is pushed to an internal QUEUE, where another separete Thread process it. So the Threads that trigger the
 * "original" Events and the Threads streamed by this class are different.
