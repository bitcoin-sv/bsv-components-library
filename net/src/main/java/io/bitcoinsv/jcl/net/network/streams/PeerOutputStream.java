 * A PeerOutputStream is an abstraction that allows us to write data to a destination. It only allows us to either
 * SEND data, or CLOSE the channel. Both scenarios are represented by specific events. Instead of just sending
 * the data, we send instead an instance of StreamEventData, that will allow us to addBytes metadata (or useful data
 * like timestamp, user info, etc) in the future.
