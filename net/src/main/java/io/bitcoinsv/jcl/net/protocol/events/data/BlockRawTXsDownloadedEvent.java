 * An Event triggered when a Set of TXs from a Block has been downloaded. If you want to get notified when all the
 * TXs have been downloaded and the block has been fully download, use the BlockDownloadedEvent.
 *
 * NOTE: This event stores Transactions in RAW format (byte array), and it might contain partial Txs inside. So
 * in order to reconstruct the Txs, yoÂ¡ll have to either develop a try-catch mechanism to deserialize them until
 * you come accross the last one which is not completed, or you wait until you get all events like this one from
 * the block, so you can reconstruct it completely.
