 * An Event triggered when a Block has been fully downloaded, including its TXs. Since a Block could potentially
 * use more memory than the HW available, this Event only notifies the FACT that the block has been downloaded, and
 * also provides some info about it (like the Block Header, or the Peer it's been downloaded from).
 *
 * If you need to process the actual content of the block while it's being downloaded, you can listen to other
 * events, like the following:
 *
 * @see LiteBlockDownloadedEvent
 * @see MsgReceivedEvent (when the Msg is of type PartialBlockHeaderMSg or PartialBlockTXsMsg)
