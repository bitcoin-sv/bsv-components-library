 * An PeerInputStream is an abstraction that works as a source of Data connected to a Peer, of which
 * we do not have control. Since we cannot control when the data is sent, we can only assign callbacks/EventHandlers
 * that will get triggered when the data arrives.
 *
 * We can get notified of 2 types of Events:
 *  - When some data arrives
 *  - When the data stream is closed.
 *
 *  In both cases we can define callbacks that will be triggered on those scenarios. Each scenario is represented by
 *  an specific event, and the callback is just a Consumer of that Event.
 *  We can add more than one callback/eventHandler to one event, or nothing at all.
 *
 *  An InputStream does NOT provide information about the SOURCE of the data. That information can be specified
 *  when creating instances that implement this class
 *
