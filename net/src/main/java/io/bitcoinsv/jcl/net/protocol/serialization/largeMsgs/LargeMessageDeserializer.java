 * Operatisn implemented by a Deserializer (Only Deserializer) of Large Messages. A Large message is a
 * message that, due to its length, cannot be contained fully in memory. So the Deserialization in this
 * case will never produce a single Java Object, but smaller parts of it. The original Message is
 * deserialized into small Java objects, and those objects are returned in sequence. Since multiple objects are
 * returned and we cannot hold them together in a single return, we need a callback mechanism so the different
 * parts are returned as they are generated.
