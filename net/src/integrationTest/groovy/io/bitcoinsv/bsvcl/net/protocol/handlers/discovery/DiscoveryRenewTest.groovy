/**
 * Integration Test Class for the Discovery Handler Renew Process.
 *
 * The Discovery Handler has 2 processes responsible for renewing the POOL of Addresses:
 * - POOL Renew Process: The "normal" process. On a frequency basis, this process selects some of the Peers we
 *   already have in our Pool, and will ask them for more addresses.
 *
 * - HANDSHAKE Renew Process: This process also runs on a frequency basis. It also selects Peers from our POOL to ask
 *   them for new Addresses, but this time it only focus on those Peers that have ever been handshaked.
 *
 * INTERNET CONNECTION IS NEEDED FOR THIS TEST.
