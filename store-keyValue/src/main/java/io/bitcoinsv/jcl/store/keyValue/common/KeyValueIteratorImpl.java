 *
 * A Base implementation of the KeyValueIterator. Even though each DB-specific Iterator will have to implement their
 * own DB Connection logic, some functionalities are common to all of them. This class provides the common
 * functionality, which is getting the next element form the DB, checking if its correct, and also checking if there
 * are more elements in the Db. These operations, in turn, will rely on inner methods that will need to be developed
 * by an implementation.specific class.
 *
 * Its possible to parametrize:
 *
 *  - The preffix: The iterator will start from the first Key that starts withthe given preffix.
 *
 *  - The suffix: The Iterator will only return thos Kes that ends witht he given suffix.
 *
 *  - The Item-BuilderFunction: For each Key, the Iterator will validate it agains the parameters (the preffix and
 *    suffix) above, and if valid, it will return a new "Item", which can be retrieved from the Client-side by calling
 *    the "next()" method. This "item" might be the Key itself, or the Value, or any other value. In order to make this
 *    generic, a Function can be specified, which will be invoked to "build" each Item returned by the "next()" method.
 *
 *  - The "keyVerifier" function: The Iterator will only process those KEys that are Valid, and a Key is valid when
 *    it starts with the given Preffix and ends with the given Suffix. But an additional validation can be also
 *    specified by the "keyVerifier" function, which is a Predicate that is applied over each Key. Thi sis useful if we
 *    only want to return those Keys that fullfill some conditions.
 *
 *
 * @param <I>   Type of the ITEM returned by the Iterator ("next()" method)
 * @param <T>   Type of the TRANSACTION used by the DB-specific implementation. If Transactions are NOT suported, the
 *              "Object" Type can be used.
 * @param <E>   Type of each ENTRY in the DB. Each Key-Value DB implementation usually provides Iterators that returns
 *              Entries from the DB (KeyValue in FoundationDB, a Map.Entry in LevelDb, etc).
 *
 *
 *  Any class extending this class will usually need to have a reference to the "DB-specific" iterator, which is the
 *  one that iterates over the "real" data from the DB. that data will get received in this class, the verifications
 *           will be applied on it, and the final "Items" wilbe returned to the Client.
